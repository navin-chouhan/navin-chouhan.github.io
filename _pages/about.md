# Work Experience
## ShopX, Bangalore
Worked as a Data Science Intern Dec 2018 | Feb 2019
: - Create a fraud detection mechanism for their onboarding process.
: - The mechanism involves detection and validation of consumer’s national id cards and verifying information on id card with the details provided by the consumer.
: - The mechanism also helps in classifying the shop type by the shop images provided by the consumer.
: - The internship involves reals life use case of deep learning and artificial intelligence and involves build models from scratch.
## Center for Development of Advanced Computing, Pune
Worked with Dr.Narendra Karmarkar,Indian mathematician Jun 2017 | Jul 2017
: - Creating Web pages using python CGI to create an environment vaguely like BlueJ.
: - The Environment creates function definitions for FORTRAN, C and python.
: - Incorporating a latex environment into the web-page.
## IIT Mandi
Worked with Dr.Padmanabhan, Asst. Professor IIT Mandi Dec 2016 | Jan 2017
: - Exploiting energy method to remove noise and extract useful segment of bird speech.
: - Creating Graphical User Interface for the program using PyQt, scipy and numpy.

# Languages and Technologies
Computer Language Skills
: C, C++, Python, Scala, JavaScript, PHP, SQL, CSS, C#.

Other Tools 
: Tensorflow, Keras, Apache Spark, Docker, Python CGI, Hadoop, Unity.

# Projects
## Video Stenography Attack(Group Project)
Skills and Tools:Python, Keras, GAN networks
: Steganography is a method of embedding a secret video in a cover video. So that only some specific person can see the video.Our project focuses on recovering the secret video from the cover video even if someone has destroyed some part of the video. We have trained two networks N1, N2.

: N1 generates a video frame by embedding the secret video(multiple times at different position) in the cover video. Such that the generated video frame looks exactly like the cover video frame.

: N2 can extract out the secret video even if some part of the video is destroyed(limited by some threshold).
## Colouring Grayscale Cartoon Videos(Group Project)
Skills and Tools:Python, Keras, GAN networks
: Neural style transfer is an optimization technique used to take two images—a content image and a style reference image — and blend them so the output image looks like the content image, but “painted” in the style of the style reference image.

: Our project focuses on videos instead of the image, which helps network remember the scene contextwhile colouring. We have trained two networks a generator and a discriminator network.

: Generator is trained to generate colour video frames from the grayscale video frames.

: Discriminator is trained to discriminate between the real and fake coloured.
## Disturbing Network Traffic over Leased lines(Group Project)
Skills and Tools:IP tables rules, Bonding
: We Designed a high-availability gateway which automatically switches between two connections in case of failure or restoration of any of the connection. The service work through a backup connection and monitors the health of the connection. In doing this switching task the service and user are not getting interrupted. Also when both the connections are live the traffic is distributed over them according to their health.
## Generic Drug Store(Group Project)
Skills and Tools:Python, beautifulsoup4, Google Map API
: Scraped generic medicine data, their corresponding non generic medicines and local medicine stores Geo-locations from more than 1000 web pages using beautifulsoup4 and python multi-threading. Created a SQL database which can map similar non-generic drugs and an online medical store to avail the cheapest available option having similar drug content. Also incorporated the facility of buying medicines form your nearest store using Google maps API.

# Short Projects
## Traveling Salesman Problem(Group Project)
Skills and Tools:C++, Python, matplotlib
: Computed the tour for traveling salesman problem on the euclidean and non-euclidean data set by simulated annealing with edge replacement. Real-time visual simulation of the path is generated with Python matplotlib.
## Implemented an Intelligent bot to play Othello(Revesrei) Game(Group Project)
Skills and Tools:C++
: Othello is a two player board game,both player place their coins(Red and Black) on a board at valid places.The game ends when neither of player can make valid move and the player who has maximum number of coins wins.For each bot’s move,bot generate game tree of the further moves with a height bound and select best move using alpha-beta pruning algorithm.
